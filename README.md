This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Github Card App

## Project Overview: 
The goal: A Search Page for Github users which has an "input/search box". When the user enters username and searches for that user, the list of all the users related to that username comes. Then on clicking on that username, there is a dialog box that gets open and shows the details of the current user.


### How to Run?

* [Live Project Click Here](https://vikasahu.github.io/git-card-app)

OR 

In the project directory, you can install and run the project by following command:

### `npm install && npm start `

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.



### Note about live project

Github api has limited number of request.If you will reload/refresh frequently, it will block the request and the api will fail. So in live project you may see it not working properly. So better option is you clone this repo and then run to your local.

### Note about sorting option and admin flag

Currently sorting is based on id and not on score (as score is coming same for almost all users).
For admin flag - search for "scottdensmore" and then there you will see a profile with admin flag.
